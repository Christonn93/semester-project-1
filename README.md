## Getting Started

### Installing

```bash
Download .zip or open with github desktop
```

```bash
if(download .zip === true){ 
    then you will need to unzip the download to be able to open the page in the browser.
};
```

### Running

This is a static page. So to run this in the browser i would suggest to use visual studio code extension [Live Server Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=negokaz.live-server-preview)

## Acknowledgments

I would like to say a big thanks to the following people for assisting me in getting my
result in the form of feedback, useful insights and interactive videos.
1. MJ Philips, Thanks for the help in my project. With videos guiding me on how to
make my dropdown work in js. Even if we are not yet at this part of the learning
it was really useful.
2. Bonita Diener. Thank you for giving me feedback on the design aspect of my
project.
3. Oliver Dipple. Thank you for giving me an image and describing how to create
my header design in code. I did not use it in the project, but it helps me
understand more of the flexbox model.
4. A massive thanks to my classmates that have been a huge help in solving
issues. Not by giving me the code, but simply giving me tips, feedback and
guidance on where to improve, read and find more information relative to my
issues.
